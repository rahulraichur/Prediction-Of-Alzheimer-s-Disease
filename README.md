A project to predict if a person is suffering from alzheimer's disease using machine learning techniques.
Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive, and irreversible neurodegenerative disease clinically manifested by amnesia, cognitive dysfunction, and gradual loss of multiple other brain functions and daily living independency. 
The number of patients with AD worldwide is expected to increase from the current 47 million to 152 million by 2050, causing serious economic, medical, and societal consequences. 
The pathogenesis of AD remains not fully elucidated and no available therapy can cure AD or completely stop disease progression. 
Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between cognitively normal aging and AD, and patients with MCI are more likely to develop AD than age-matched healthy cognition (HC). Early detection of AD by screening MCI is crucial both for effective management and care strategies and for developing new drugs and measures to prevent further deterioration of the disease.
Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has enabled non-invasive in vivo investigations of AD-related changes in the brain.
A large number of promising machine learning applications have used MRI for AD prediction, which include random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and boosting algorithms. 
Even so, existing machine learning approaches typically involve manual selection of pre-defined brain regions of interest (ROIs) based on known MRI features of AD. 
Given the limited understanding of definitive MRI biomarkers for AD, it is likely that pre-selected ROIs cannot include all the information potentially useful to uncover the complexity of AD. Manual selection can also be prone to subjective errors and be time-consuming and labor-intensive.
