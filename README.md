### Introduction:

We propose to implement a deep-learning framework that will segment the affected part of the brain in the MRI scans along with predicting severity of the alzheimer's disease.

We are going to deploy the model with simple interactive user interface - **Health Lab** on web platform.

Our [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yVL8I-bt9WNGl4_27r4kq4FxgDIy60_ke0O30EIWrjg/edit#slide=id.gb1f8aa6de7_5_1810) and [demo_video](./demo/site_demo-2020-12-19_11.03.47.mp4)

### Results




### Installation

Fork this repository.

Then move to the desired directory in your PC and type in the terminal

```shell
git clone https://github.com/chetanpandey1266/FallFest-VWXYZ.git

cd web_app_with_ml_backend

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now your webapp is ready to run on your localhostðŸ˜„
